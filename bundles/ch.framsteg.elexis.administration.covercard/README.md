# CovercardÂ® Feature

## Description
The Covercard plugin queries patient data starting from the cardnumber which acts as a kind of primary key. The resulting patient data is displayed to the user (transient) but only the identifiers are persisted in the database. The plugin allows to inspect the data to find out missing patient properties.

## Technical note

- The plugin sends the query to [http://covercard.hin.ch/covercard/servlet/ch.ofac.ca.covercard.CaValidationHorizontale?type=XXX&langue=1&carte=YYY&ReturnType=42a](http://covercard.hin.ch/covercard/servlet/ch.ofac.ca.covercard.CaValidationHorizontale?type=XXX&langue=1&carte=YYY&ReturnType=42a)

- The plugin uses a HIN proxy to secure the sensitive data

- The plugin receives a XML repsonse containing all the patient's data

- The plugin stores the following values in the Elexis database:
    - The insurance number using the key _www.xid.ch/covercard/insured-number_
    - The card number using the key _www.xid.ch/covercard/card-number_
    - The insured person number using the key _www.xid.ch/covercard/insured-person-number_

## How to install
