## Subordinated Plugin(s)

## Description
The Analytics/Reporting Plugin (ch.framsteg.elexis.finance.analytics) answers question like *How much money have I earned within a certain period?* or *Which was the most successful year/month?* and *How does the daily report of specific day look like?* and so forth. The information is retrieved by eight different queries:

* Sales per clearable medical services and devices, pharmaceuticals and laboratory analysis _(Umsatz/Leistung)_
* Sales per clearable medical services and devices, pharmaceuticals and laboratory analysis per year _(Umsatz/Leistung/Jahr)_
* Sales per clearable medical services and devices, pharmaceuticals and laboratory analysis per year/month _(Umsatz/Leistung/Jahr/Monat)_
* Sales per year _(Umsatz/Jahr)_
* Sales per year/month _(Umsatz/Jahr/Monat)_
* Sales Tarmed per year/month _(Umsatz Tarmed/Jahr/Monat)_
* Sales Pharmaceuticals per year/month _(Umsatz Medikamente/Jahr/Monat)_
* Daily Report _(Tagesrapport)_

All queries can optionally be constrained by upper and lower time limits _from_ resp. _to_. Without limits the queries deliver key data over the whole time periode of a medical practice. The resulting data refers to the mandant the logged on user belongs to and can be exported as either PDF or CSV.

## How to install
The plugin can easily be installed via _Help/Install New Software_. The feature _Analytics/Reporting_ is listed within the _Statistik_ category. During start it checks if the required database system (PostgreSQL exclusively) is used. If so the necessary materialized view is created automatically. The plugin is ready to use.
