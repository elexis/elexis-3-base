CHANGELOG
=========

0.7
---

- Initial implementation

0.8
---

- Minor code refactorings
- Refactored dashboard composites and messages

- Fixed date bugs in dashboard charts

- Added on-demand chart creation in dashboard
- Added actions instead of buttons for dashboard functions


0.8.1
-----

- Fixed bug where the dataset would not be sorted along with
  the table on the selection page in the chart builder wizard
- Fixed bug where exported filenames would have no filetype attached.

- Added copy selected items command. Items from the main view's 
  table can now be copied into the clipboard.
  
- Removed the private "size" variable from an AbstractDatProvider.
  Only used while running the job and thus does not need to be an object variable.
  Pay attention to this when implementing your data providers.
  
0.9
---

- AbstractFieldComposite now return proper values according to their type.

- Code cleanup, Javadoc enhancements.
 
0.9.1
-----

- Fixed a bug where classes in dataset that do not directly implement 
  the "Comparable" interface would be compared by their "toString" method.
  
   
0.9.2
-----

- Added a "category" element to the extension point definition. This way
  implementing plugins can define categories to group providers in the 
  provider list in the UI. The category is used as a prefix for the providers
  in that list.

- Fixed bug where DB queries in the dashboard returned false total values.
- Fixed bug where changing mandate / user would leave the chart creation button
  in dashboard inactive.
